## What is a Beacon?

The _Beacon_ project was launched in 2014 to show the willingness of researchers to enable the secure sharing of genomic data from participants of genomic studies. _Beacons_ are web-servers that answer questions such as _Does your dataset include a genome that has a specific nucleotide (e.g. G) at a specific genomic coordinate (e.g. Chr.1 position 111,111)?_ to which the _Beacon_ must respond with _yes_ or _no_, without referring to a specific individual.
