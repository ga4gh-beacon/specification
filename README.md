# ARCHIVE: Beacon v1

The Beacon v1 specification has not been updated since 2020 and has been replaced with the Beacon v2 specification, officially approved in Spring 2022. Please see the [documentation site](http://docs.genomebeacons.org) and the [code repository](http://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/).

The implementation of "v1" type beacons is now discouraged; beacons can be configured in v2 with v1-like functionality.

## What is a Beacon?

The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. It provides a framework for public web services responding to queries against genomic data collections, for instance from population based or disease specific genome repositories.

The Beacon protocol has been designed to be:

* Simple: focus on robustness and easy implementation
* Federated: maintained by individual organizations and assembled into a network
* General-purpose: used to report on any variant collection
* Aggregative: provide a boolean (or quantitative) answer about the observation of a variant
* Privacy protecting: queries do not return information about single individuals

The main places to find information about the Beracon project are:

* Beacon project [website](https://beacon-project.io)
* short documentation about the specification [in this repository](./beacon.md)
* [wiki](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification/wiki) (outdated)


## Specification

The specification is done in [OpenAPI format](beacon.yaml) and it is online in [Swagger Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ELIXIR-Finland/ga-4_gh_beacon_api_specification/1.0.0-rc1). The overall design is explained in the [beacon.md](beacon.md) document.
